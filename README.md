using GA(genetic algorithm) with group selection to solve Orienteering Problem

the detail of the algorithm can be read in the paper " A Genetic Algorithm with Grouping Selection and Searching Operators for the Orienteering Problem" from Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems. 

the data set is chosen from the paper " Heuristic Methods Applied to Orienteering" from Journal of the Operational Research Society, 1984, 35(9):797-809. You can modify the file 'NODE.py' to create your own dataset and make no change in other file.

you can change Tmax, population and other parameters of GA in the file 'main.py'.
